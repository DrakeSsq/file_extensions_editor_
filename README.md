# file_extensions_editor_
The user selects a file without an extension, and the program determines the extension by its signature and installs it.

The program consists of 3 classes. Initially, the user has the ability to navigate through the directory in search of the desired file. 

### Commands:
* cd - change directory
* ls - show directory contents
* take - select a file
* see - view the selected file
* test - view the signature of the file
* rename - rename the file (substitute the extension)
* exit - exit the program

Perhaps the functionality is quite easy and it can be improved in every possible way, for example, add more extensions or commands for moving directories, but the program fulfills its essence.
